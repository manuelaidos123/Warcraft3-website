                    <h3>Races strategies, pros and cons</h3>
                    <h4 id="Human">How To Basic: Human</h4>
                    <p>
                        Human units for the most part are fragile and without much brute force, but they take advantage of carefully developed technology and magic, to bring foes to their knees. 
                    </p>
                    <h5>Pros</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Great expanding possibilities</li>
                        <p>With the peasants ability to do cooperative building, you can build a Town Hall very quickly compared to other races. With masonry upgrades from the Lumber Mill you can also create a defense with towers that is difficult to penetrate for the opponent. While Human expansions are costly and therefor quite a commitment, they are often the key to unlocking your powerful tech-tree.</p>
                        <li>Militia creeping</li>
                        <p>Another very useful function peasants have is, that they can be called to arms and become militia. Although they are quite vulnerable, they deal as much damage as a footman, so pulling a couple of them will allow to immediately creep big camps and thus getting a level and item advantage right off the bat.</p>
                        <li>Broad spectrum of possibilities</li>
                        <p>Every single Human unit sees use. This makes it possible to hard counter most of what your opponent throws at you. Though it might seem overwhelming to learn so many different compositions for newer players, I think it have some clear benefits. Races such as Orc and Undead can use the same unit compositions in almost all games. While that is easy to grasp, it also makes it very difficult to see where you can improve your games compared to Human who will have to learn transitioning with very drastic changes throughout the games.</p>
                        <li>Staff of Sanctuary</li>
                        <p>This is a super powerful item, and vastly underrated by many of the new players I have talked to. Giving Human players the possibility to salvage heroes and units from a fight and healing them up fully is simply great.</p>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>Cons</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fragile units</li>
                        <p>If a Human army gets caught on the wrong foot, unprepared without a Scroll of Teleportation, the opponent can quickly tear the army apart, due to the units' low durability.</p>
                        <li>Can be bullied early game</li>
                        <p>Having an enemy hero interrupting your creeping or expansion can be very frustrating to play against as a Human. In the early game where you only have your hero and a couple of footmen, your only option will often be to flee from a Blademaster attacking you.</p>
                    </ul>
                    <h4 id="Orc">How To Basic: Orc</h4>
                    <h5>Pros</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hard to kill</li>
                        <p>Orc has a natural hardiness with high hit point units, complimented by many spells and abilities that sustain fights and keep the Orc army healthy. They also benefit from a shared armor upgrade for all units, which helps encourage a play style of long drawn out battles.</p>
                        <li>Strong racial hero options</li>
                        <p>All the Orc heroes are incredibly powerful and are all used in several different scenarios. Orc is arguably the race that has the strongest tri-hero combination.</p>
                        <li>Voodoo language</li>
                        <p>Every item in the Orc shop is invaluable and mends Orc's weaknesses well. Efficient healing with salves, the unique Tiny Great Hall for late game expansions, a powerful Orb and the incredible speed scroll which too often goes underappreciated by newer players.</p>
                        <li>Strong presence at Tier 2</li>
                        <p>All but one of the Orc units are available at Tier 2, which allows them the unique ability to field their late game army early on. This entails them hitting a strong power spike once their Tier 2 units take the field, giving them a good map presence.</p>
                        <li>Loads of lock-down</li>
                        <p>Orcs have a ton of ways to lock down enemy units, which especially ties well with Blademasters high damage output. Between War Stomp, Hex, Ensnare and Orb of Lightning you can be sure to have ways of pinning down the opponent.</p>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>Cons</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Weak late game powerhouse unit</li>
                        <p>The other races all have strong Tier 3 units that, if permitted, can be devastating in high population battles. Orc has the Tauren which, while strong on the ground, is easily crowd controlled or focused by the other races' big hitters such as Frost Wyrms, Gryphon Riders or Chimeras.</p>
                        <li>Vulnerable key buildings</li>
                        <p>Any player who has a few Orc games under their belt has keenly felt the pain of their burrows being destroyed, delaying their second hero or first Tier 2 units. They are the only race who have a supply building that does not have fortified armor, making them ripe for the picking. In addition they have a very predictable Tier 2 timing where they must build their Tier 2 production buildings, which is regularly exploited by opponents to delay the Orc's progress.</p>
                        <li>No magic immunity / weak anti-magic</li>
                        <p>Orc is the only race with no magic immune units.This leads to the massing of spells or magic damage being quite effective, as we see with the commonly used mass casters by Night Elf (Talons) and Human (Sorceresses/Priests). In addition, the anti-magic from Spirit Walkers is not nearly as attractive as the other races selections.</p>
                        <li>Limited anti-air options</li>
                        <p>Orcs deal well with a cloud of low hit point airborne units such as Gargoyles or Flying Machines due to Bat Riders, but have less tools to deal with the likes of Frost Wyrms, Destroyers and Gryphon Riders.</p>
                    </ul>
                    <h4 id="Undead">How To Basic: Undead</h4>
                    <h5>Pros</h5>
                    <p>Undead is notorious for being great at bursting down targets one by one. The most obvious reason for this is the devastating combination of Death Coil and Frost Nova. It's, however, not the only reason, as Undead also have several other traits which assist bursting single targets. Among these Orb of Corruption, Crypt Fiends and Destroyers - but more on that later. </p>
                    <p>Allowing you to both creep efficiently, harass and scout, Rod of Necromancy offers a lot of versatility. A must have in all matchups.</p>
                    <p>An Undead base with a good layout is nearly impenetrable for the enemy. Workers are hidden well in the back, the slow from your main structure and Nerubian towers makes both fighting and running away much more inconvenient for your opponent, and the structures are generally quite bulky.</p>
                    <p>With Undead you reach some strong peaks in terms of power level, which you can use to land devastating attacks against your opponent if timed correctly.</p>
                    <p>Undead is not a race with a lot of flexibility for creative and innovative play styles, but they have a ton of room for refinement. If you micro well you can achieve an incredible amount and win fights that you, on paper, have no business of winning. </p>
                    <h5>Cons</h5>
                    <p>Until you achieve Obsidian Statues you don't have much sustain. The Tomb of Relics contains no Clarity Potion for mana, nor items for healing like Scroll of Regeneration or Healing Salves and Ritual Dagger is widely considered a poor item in the vast majority of situations. Furthermore, your units don't have any natural regeneration except when standing on Blight. Even in the late game when you have Obsidian Statues, your sustain can feel underwhelming as it still doesn't quite compare to Brilliance Aura/Priests, Healing Wave/Spirit Link or Moon Wells/Rejuvenation in terms of healing 'burst'.  </p>
                    <p>One of the key elements of a well-rounded army composition is lock-down. Orcs have Ensnare/Hex, Humans have Slow/Storm Bolt, and Night Elves have Entangle/Slow Poison. Undead rely on Lich's Frost Nova, which really doesn't compare well to the others. Undead also have other means of lock-down, but they are not really used for various reasons that we'll go over later.</p>
                    <p>Undead is the only race that doesn't have dispelling effects before tier 3, when they can get Destroyers. Dispelling effects are vital in many scenarios in order to dispell powerfull enemy buffs or debuffs. Another reason why tier 3 is so important is the Orb of Corruption. Even though it recently got nerfed a bit, it's still an important addition to the Undead army capabilities.</p>
                    <h4 id="Elves">How To Basic: Night Elves</h4>
                    <h5>Pros</h5>
                    <p>Free healing and free mana regeneration makes these arguably the best food-production building in the game. Night Elf does not, however, have any good alternative healing before they get Rejuvenation from Druid of the Claw, so use the Moon Juice carefully!</p>
                    <p>Much like Human, Night Elf has a wide collection of viable units. This allows them to be very versatile and able to adapt to any given situation.</p>
                    <p>Creeping with the Ancient of War allows Night Elf to ‘cheat-creep’ strong creep camps very early on in the game. This is advantageous as it can give a nice edge in the early game against the opponent. The convenient creeping also allows for more flexibility, opening the possibility up for Night Elf to utilize Tavern heroes quite well.</p>
                    <p>Both permanent items in the Night Elf shop (Orb of Venom and Staff of Preservation) are great, but I often find that new players tend to undervalue Staff of Preservation heavily. Great item on its own and even better when paired with Moon Wells for healing staffed units.</p>
                    <h5>Cons</h5>
                    <p>While Night Elves have a lot of good starter heroes, they do not really have any hero that is good at supporting their army like the other races. In certain situations a DH or KotG 2nd can be good, but that is under quite niche circumstances. As they are picked to specifically counter the opponent, their supportive capabilities just pale in comparison to heroes like Paladin, Shadow Hunter and Death Knight. This also leads to Night Elves rarely getting a 3rd hero, despite them getting tier 3 very often.</p>
                    <p>While a high-leveled Demon Hunter is nothing to scuff at, I think it is fair to say that Night Elves' late game is the worst between all the races. As mentioned before, they usually only have 2 heroes, so - given enough time - the tri-hero combinations of the other races will eventually out-scale the Night Elf. On top of that, their units are not great for big late game fights either. To make up for the worse late game, Night Elves will usually have to win through getting an advantage throughout the game (like an expansion, or higher hero levels).</p>
