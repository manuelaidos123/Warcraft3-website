                        <h2 id="arthas-heading">Arthas Menethil</h2>
                        <p>Arthas Menethil was the heir to the throne of Lordaeron. He had a romantic relationship and was a well trained soldier. Everything looked promising for Arthas, but when the Scourge launched the plague invasion on his homeland, he became more and more possessed trying to find a way to end it. He slowly lost his way of judgement, and soon ordered the entire city of Stratholme to be purged. From here, Arthas lost more and more of his judgement, which eventually led him to claim the cursed runeblade, Frostmourne, for himself in order to save his homeland. The runeblade tormented his body and he soon became one of the most powerful and evil beings in Azeroth.</p>

She is the daughter of Grand Admiral Daelin Proudmoore and one of the most powerful human sorceress on Azeroth. She and Arthas shared a strong friendship that led to very serious romance, however the Scourge invasion and their duties to Dalaran and Lordaeron forced them to put their relationship on hold for a time.</p>
                        <p>In Warcraft III, Jaina Proudmore is best know for leaving Arthas' side when he decides the best way to stop the outbreak of the plague is the purge the city of Stratholme. When Uther refused to purge the city as ordered, Arthas charged him with treason and disbanded the Order of the Silver Hand. He demanded that any true to the king stay with him and see to the town's destruction. Jaina turned and followed Uther to Arthas' surprise. She left just as the invasion of Lordaeron began, saving thousands of citizens from the Scourge invasion.</p>

He became one of the Lich King's most important servants, and he was responsible for unleashing the undeath plague in Lordaeron. Kel'Thuzad was slain by Arthas, who then later resurrected by him as a lich, so he could summon Archimonde the Defiler.

During the third war, Sylvanas was a defender of Silvermoon during the invasion of the Scourge. She battled against the forces being led by Arthas Menethil, but was pushed back into a constant retreat by the seemingly endless horde of undead at his command. Eventually, Arthas took on Sylvanas himself, and she was wounded mortally during the fight.</p>
                        <p>Arthas however, would not give her the peace that death would bring her, and instead her tortured what remained of her, until finally she died. As a means of petty revenge, Arthas brought Sylvanas back as one of the first High Elf banshees. As a mindless tool of the Scourge, she helped lay siege to her own homelands, and aided Arthas in his quest to take control of the Sunwell.</p>
